 <p><b>Hughes STEM High School</b> prepares students for careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). At Hughes’ internationally accredited and STEM-certified through the Ohio STEM Learning Network high school, students focus on project-based learning and critical-thinking through the use of technology.
<br><br>
Hughes’ Preparatory Academy for grades 7-9, provides academic and career technical experiences in addition to social and emotional support to ensure that students are prepared for the high expectations of honors-level courses and dual enrollment in College Credit Plus and AP Courses.
<br><br>
In the Professional Academy for grades 10-12, students declare a STEM major and are
challenged with rigorous coursework in one of the five pathways:
<ul>
  <li><b>Health Sciences</b> - Preparing students for college and career opportunities in the fields of medicine, patient care, and research</li>
  <li><b>Plant and Animal Sciences</b> - Teaches animal care, plant conservation, and environmental studies provided by the Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden’s nationally recognized Zoo Academy</li>
  <li><b>STEM Leadership</b> - Students earn Lean Six Sigma Project Management Industry Credentials working with industry leaders in the STEM fields</li>
  <li><b>Software Development</b> - Introduces the skills to create, test, and evaluate software operating systems and applications used for everything from computer operations and workplace productivity to gaming and entertainment</li>
  <li><b>Engineering Futures</b> - Teaches the design processes in civil, mechanical, biomedical, nanotechnology, and sustainability engineering to solve various problems</li>
</ul>
A partnership with University of Cincinnati offers several opportunities to students, including internships and enrichment classes for seniors. The UC EarlyIT college program allows students to complete the first year of its Bachelor of Science Information Technology (BSIT) program. Students who earn at least a C receive automatic admission into the BSIT program.
